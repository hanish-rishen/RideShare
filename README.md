# RideShare

Welcome to RideShare! This project aims to foster a community of students and office workers who share rides within and around a university campus or workplace. By leveraging Supabase for backend services, Next.js for the frontend, and other open-source tools, RideShare provides a platform for users to offer or request rides, significantly reducing travel expenses and environmental impact.

## Use-Cases
## Scenario 1: Transit between Office and Housing Soceity
Raj and Neha both live in Green Meadows and work at Tech Park.
Raj's shift starts at 9 AM, and Neha's ends at 9 AM. Every day, they awkwardly wave at each other as they pass by, thinking, "Why am I paying for a full ride when we could just share?"
With RideShare, Raj and Neha finally solve this daily dilemma. Raj offers a ride to Tech Park, starting from Green Meadows at 8:30 AM. Neha, finishing her night shift at 9 AM, hops onto the same two-wheeler for a ride back to Green Meadows. They split the cost, saving money and time.

## Scenario 2: Transit between College and Housing Soceity
Imagine Rahul and Mukesh, both living in Abode Valley but with opposite schedules. Rahul heads to campus at 12 PM while Mukesh returns home at the same time. Through RideShare, they can pair up, share a rented bike, and split the costs. Rahul brings the bike to campus, and Mukesh takes it back home, saving both time and money. This concept can be applied to popular office spaces and housing areas, making commuting efficient and affordable.
